# sx-portfolio
A demonstration of technical capabilities. A combination of code and machine learning notebooks in R and Python. Please note that these files are merely meant to give the viewer a sense of the breadth & depth of my experience. All work is my own (or, when noted, a product of team work).

The following files are included:
- `random-acts-of-pizza`: This folder contains Python scripts and a Jupyter Notebook used for running several simple algorithms (K-Nearest Neighbors) on data from the Kaggle competition "Random Acts of Pizza" to try and predict whether a Reddit post would receive free pizza or not. This was a team effort with majority contribution from myself.
- `analysis_of_causal_claim`: My thoughts on a paper claiming causality between the age at onset of diabetes and risk of dementia.
- `causal_inference_study_analysis`: These files are the result of a study performed by myself and 3 other team members, on whether facial expressions can impact subject trust in a true story.
- `movie_genre_classification`: These files demonstrate a BERT task for a multilabel, multiclass problem, classifying movie genres from movie summaries. The code was written in partnership with one other team member.
